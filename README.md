## How to use?

All items in the **GraphQKL Checklist** are recommended for the majority of the projects, but some elements can be omitted or are not essential. We choose to use 3 levels of flexibility:

* ![Low][low_img] means that the item is **recommended** but can be omitted in some particular situations.
* ![Medium][medium_img] means that the item is **highly recommended** and can eventually be omitted in some really particular cases. Omitting these that engineers may not work at full speed.
* ![High][high_img] means that the item **can't be omitted** by any reason. You may risk security issues in your graphql application. The testing priority needs to be on these elements first.

Some resources possess an emoticon to help you understand which type of content / help you may find on the checklist:

* ðŸ“–: documentation or article
* ðŸ› : online tool / testing tool
* ðŸ“¹: media or video content

> You can contribute to the ***GraphQL Checklist App*** reading the [README_APP file](https://github.com/zachlendon/graphql-checklist/blob/master/README_APP.md) which explains everything about the project.
